*) Tables "%_join_%" are not correctly indicized for doing queries relying
   on coordinates or SNP_name
   
    - Selecting for a position or a SNP name require a full table scan for
      each query
      
    - Queries in SNPchimp browse page require a full table scan

*) Could be possible to give to SNPchiMpVep.py the query constructed in 
   snpchimp php files instead of a list of SNPs? In such way, I can search
   all snps selected via snpchimp browser.
   
*) Write the VCF file used in input in order to do VeP manually

*) Graphical rapresentation of SNPs?

*) Could be possible to give to SNPchiMpVep.py the query constructed in 
   snpchimp php files instead of a list of SNPs? In such way, I can search
   all snps selected via snpchimp browser.
   
   - ask to Andrea/Eze/Nelson. Maybe can be useful for donwload page?
   
*) Write the VCF file used in input in order to do VeP manually

   - At the momente VCF file is writtein in StringIO object

*) The REF base of the VCF file is a N. Determine the real sequence

*) Graphical rapresentation of SNPs?

*) Horse doesn't work {"error":"something bad has happened"}

*) Sheep doens't work {"error":"something bad has happened"}

*) Testing module for all species defined in snpchimp

The python virtualenv ENVironment isn't a good idea. I could call /cgi-bin/queryVeP/ENV/bin/easy_install
Install the required module system wide or in a directory outside apache
